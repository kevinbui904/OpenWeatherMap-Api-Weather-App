#This program pings openweathermap API and convert
#the information into json format. It then
#interprets the information and display graphics
#to show weather condition in different cities
#around the world. Users could manually input city
#name from an input box, or they could generate
#a map (within) the program, to ping the city
#by its latitude/longitude
